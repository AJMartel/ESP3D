# ESP3D - Async WebServer Version - This is pre-alpha and not ready for production    
It use the great https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer   

Build status : [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/luc-github/ESP3D.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/luc-github/ESP3D)    


This is the base of ESP3D V2 - several change willl come so no backward compatibility is possible with 1.0
It support [ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) and [ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32). MCU   

Be aware ESP32 core is still missing several libraries (NetBios, SSDP).    
   
Mandatories libraries are present in libraries directory    
* for ESP8266:   
    - ESPAsyncWebServer (from https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer )   
    - ESPAsyncTCP (from https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP)   
    - use lwIP version Prebuild Source GCC as some libraries are not yet compatible lwIP V2   
    
* for ESP32:    
    - ESPAsyncWebServer  (from https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer )   
    - AsyncTCP (from https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP)   
    - DNSServer (from https://github.com/bbx10/DNSServer_tng)   
    
#What UI to use ?
* index.html.gz is present in data directory based on https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D-WEBUI
* new repo will be setup to support new features for 2.0
